      <p> It's name is Pollin. I was created becasue I've seen that there is a problem going on Earth. So I'm here to solve it and to spread more awareness. My job is to suck up pollution, but I only have room for 5% of pollution. It's because I'm very small and you can take or put me anywhere. Then I'll do my job the way I was created by an click of a green button.</p>
